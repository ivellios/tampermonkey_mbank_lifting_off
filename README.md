# tampermonkey_mbank_lifting_off
Removes "lifting" styles from mBank interface

## Requirements

You will need [TamperMonkey](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/tampermonkey/dhdgffkkebhmkfjojejmpbldmpobfkfo?hl=pl) extension installed in your Chrome. 

## Instalation

Just add user.js script to your TamperMonkey and you're done. Happy banking! ;) 

## Is that secure?

First of all... I cannot guarantee that ;) 

_But since you're asking._ My script is in fact only 3 lines long and easy to read. All it does is removing proper class and adding background. Simple as that. 

For the security reasons I have removed update url for tamper monkey, so this script WILL NEVER be updated automatically unless you tell it to (which I am not encouraging you to do). Instead you can always check manually this repo (put a star for example to make it easier to find) for any updates once your script stops working. Since I will be in the same trouble, maybe you will find solution here as well. 

**Why no automatic update - you ask?** Because, that way someone (me in this case) can update scripts with some malicious code that would do nasty things to your computer and accounts. ALWAYS check the code you are going to use for tamper monkey. Never trust their creators :) 

_Unless they are Batman. Then always trust Batman._

## Contributing

Not really needed. But if anything breaks and you know how to fix it, create pull requests. I will appreciate it.
